Get to a common protocol. Kyle Duffield in a music hackspace (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YnZVLuAICI) talked about using common connectors for projects and I will expand this to common protocols. 
The flip dots are controlled via a proprietary modbus based protocaol. I want to get to something more applications can talk to. 

The display acts basicly as a 1-bit led display (on or off) so it can be controlled by the lighting protocols.
